VHDL Source and Quartus project files  

To build for a particular set of features/classes/model size, modify the associated VHDL generics  
Communication to the FPGA occurs via serial currently as this is just a prototype demonstration  
In our lab setup, we used a Bluetooth to serial adapter for portability, but a serial cable will work just fine.  
Keep in mind to use the proper voltage levels for the Stratix V.  

Note: Stratix V Devices require an active Altera/Intel Quartus License
